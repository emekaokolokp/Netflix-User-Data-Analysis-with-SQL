📊 Project Analysis Summary

This SQL analysis of the Netflix dataset explored key business questions and revealed the following findings:

Top Users by Watch Time

A small number of users account for the highest total watch hours, highlighting a core segment of loyal, heavy viewers.

Genre Preferences

Action, Drama, and Comedy emerged as the most popular genres, driving majority engagement across regions.

Subscription Plan Trends

Standard and Premium plans are more widely adopted than Basic, showing customer preference for features such as multiple profiles and higher streaming quality.

Churn Risk Assessment

Approximately X% of users (calculated from queries) are at risk of churn. These users generally report lower satisfaction and engagement.

Regional Viewing Patterns

North America and Europe show higher average daily watch times, while other regions lag, suggesting more growth opportunities.

Device Usage Behavior

Smart TVs and Mobile devices dominate as the most common streaming platforms, reinforcing the importance of optimizing Netflix’s experience on these devices.

Satisfaction vs. Churn

Higher customer satisfaction correlates strongly with lower churn, indicating that improving satisfaction directly reduces cancellations.

Engagement by Plan

Premium subscribers record higher engagement rates compared to Basic plan users, suggesting that value-added features improve customer stickiness.

📌 Insights & Recommendations
🔎 Key Insights

Top Users & Power Viewers

A small group of users contribute disproportionately to total watch time. These “power users” are highly valuable and represent the most loyal customer base.

Genre Preferences

Certain genres (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy) consistently dominate user preferences. Niche genres have lower engagement, but may appeal strongly in specific regions.

Subscription Plans

The Standard and Premium plans attract the most users, suggesting that customers value content quality and multiple profiles. Basic plans have lower adoption.

Churn Risk

A noticeable portion of users are marked as churned (Yes). Many of these users also show lower customer satisfaction scores and lower engagement rates, indicating dissatisfaction as a key churn driver.

Regional Watch Time

Users in regions like North America and Europe tend to have higher daily watch time compared to Asia and other regions. This signals stronger market maturity.

Device Usage

Smart TVs and Mobile devices dominate streaming usage. Laptops and tablets are secondary. This suggests Netflix should prioritize user experience on Smart TVs and Mobile platforms.

Customer Satisfaction & Engagement

Higher engagement rates and satisfaction scores correlate strongly with lower churn rates. Customers who engage daily and report high satisfaction are far less likely to leave.

💡 Recommendations

Retention Campaigns

Target churn-risk users with personalized offers, such as discounts, loyalty rewards, or exclusive early access to new shows.

Content Investment

Double down on top-performing genres (Action, Drama, Comedy) while selectively investing in region-specific content for localized growth.

Subscription Strategy

Promote Premium and Standard plans with bundled offers (e.g., family packages, multiple profiles) since these already show strong adoption.

User Experience Optimization

Enhance Smart TV and Mobile app performance, as these are the most popular devices for streaming. Smooth playback and personalized recommendations should be priorities.

Customer Satisfaction Initiatives

Launch initiatives to improve satisfaction scores — e.g., better customer support, AI-driven recommendations, and interactive features.

Regional Expansion

In regions with lower engagement, Netflix can run localized campaigns, leverage regional partnerships, and tailor content to cultural preferences.
